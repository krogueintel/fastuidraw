 * \brief
 * An TessellatedPath represents the tessellation of a Path
 * into line segments and arcs.
 *
 * A single contour of a TessellatedPath is constructed from
 * a single \ref PathContour of the source \ref Path. Each
 * edge of a contour of a TessellatedPath is contructed from
 * a single \ref PathContour::interpolator_base of the source \ref
 * PathContour. The ordering of the contours of a
 * TessellatedPath is the same ordering as the source
 * \ref PathContour objects of the source \ref Path. Also,
 * the ordering of edges within a contour is the same ordering
 * as the \ref PathContour::interpolator_base objects of
 * the source \ref PathContour. In particular, for each contour
 * of a TessellatedPath, if an edge is closed, the closing edge
 * is the last edge.
