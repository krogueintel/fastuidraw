 * are tracked and at program exit a list of those objects not deleted by
 * FASTUIDRAWdelete are printed with the file and line number of the allocation.
 * For release builds of FastUIDraw, allocations are not tracked and std::malloc
 * is used to allocate memory. Do NOT use FASTUIDRAWnew for creating arrays
 * (i.e. p = new type[N]) as FASTUIDRAWdelete does not handle array deletion.
