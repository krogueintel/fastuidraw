   * \brief
   * A PainterBackend is an interface that defines the API-specific
   * elements to implement \ref Painter. A fixed PainterBackend will
   * only be used by a single \ref Painter.
   *
   * A \ref Painter will use a \ref PainterBackend as follows within a
   * Painter::begin() and Painter::end() pair.
   * \code
   * fastuidraw::PainterBackend &backend;
   *
   * backend.on_painter_begin();
   * for (how many surfaces S needed to draw all)
   *   {
   *     std::vector<fastuidraw::reference_counted_ptr<fastuidraw::PainterDraw> > draws;
   *     for (how many PainterDraw objects needed to draw what is drawn in S)
   *       {
   *         fastuidraw::reference_counted_ptr<fastuidraw::PainterDraw> p;
   *
   *         p = backend.map_draw();
   *         // fill the buffers on p, potentially calling
   *         // PainterDraw::draw_break() several times.
   *         p.get()->unmap(attributes_written, indices_written, data_store_written);
   *         draws.push_back(p);
   *       }
   *     backend.on_pre_draw(S, maybe_clear_color_buffer, maybe_begin_new_target);
   *     for (p in draws)
   *       {
   *         p.get()->draw();
   *       }
   *     draws.clear();
   *     backend.on_post_draw();
   *   }
