   * A GlyphRenderDataRestrictedRays represents the data needed to
   * build a glyph to render it with a modification to the technique
   * of "GPU-Centered Font Rendering Directly from Glyph Outlines"
   * by Eric Lengyel. The modifications we have to the technique are
   * as follows.
   *  - We break the glyph's box into a hierarchy of boxes where
   *    each leaf node has a list of what curves are in the box
   *    together with a single sample point inside the box giving
   *    the winding number at the sample point.
   *  - To compute the winding number, one runs the technique
   *    on the ray connecting the fragment position to the winding
   *    sample position and increment the value by the winding value
   *    of the sample. Here the main caveat is that one needs to
   *    ignore any intersection that are not between the fragment
   *    position and the sample position.
   *  - The shader (which can be fetched with the function
   *    fastuidraw::glsl::restricted_rays_compute_coverage())
   *    tracks the closest curve (in a local L1-metric scaled to
   *    window coordinates) to the fragment position that increments
   *    the winding value and also tracks the closest curve that
   *    decrements the winding value. Using those two values together
   *    with the winding value allows the shader to compute a coverage
   *    value to perform anti-aliasing.
