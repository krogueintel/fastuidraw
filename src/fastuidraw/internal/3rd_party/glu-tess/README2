The GLU tessellator found in FASTUIDRAW has been modified from the original sources:
   - all but tessellation removed
   - arbitary winding rule
   - prefix public functions with fastuidraw_
   - prefix public macros with FASTUIDRAW_
   - change source and header files to cpp and hpp extension
   - so that API header allows for C++ niceties of overloading
   - begin call backs pass a winding number
   - remove triangle strips and fans rendering
   - remove edge flag call back
   - points provided are 2D only (skip computation of plane and projection)
   - remove malloc.h include due to it being unnecessary
   - changed fastuidraw_GLUtesselator to class to remove warning
   - a contour can be specied so that edges it adds does not affect winding
     number computation; useful for stopping tessellator from creating long
     skinny triangles by adding additional boxes
